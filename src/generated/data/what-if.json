Launching all of humanity (total weight: around 400 million tons) would therefore take tens of trillions of tons of fuel. That’s a lot; if we were using hydrocarbon-based fuels, it would represent a decent chunk of the world’s remaining oil reserves. And that’s not even worrying about the weight of the ship itself, food, water, or our pets (there are probably around a million tons of pet dog in the US alone). We’d also need fuel to produce all these ships, to transport people to the launch sites, and so forth.

The biggest engineering hurdle is that the tether would have to be several times stronger than anything we can currently build.

In 1999, some statisticians recorded the dates on 1,000 pennies they had lying around, and published the data in the book _**Workshop Statistics: Discovery with Data and Fathom**_, [page 389](http://books.google.com/books?id=wGMRja1vE0kC&lpg=PA389&pg=PA389#v=onepage&q&f=false). By plotting the frequency with which they saw pennies of various ages against the frequency we'd _**expect**_ from US Mint production numbers, we can estimate the rate at which older pennies drop out of circulation per year. Using their numbers, I come up with an estimate of about 190,000,000,000 pennies in circulation.\n\nWe can then apply the same formula to previous dates, and come up with a number for 1996, to check against the GAO number. (I have a lot of spare time on my hands.) Surprisingly, this produces an estimate that's still about 190,000,000,000. Either number (190 billion or 132 billion) is probably a reasonable estimate, but if you're serious about your penny statistics—and if you've read this far, you must be—you should probably go with the US Mint guess. After all, they presumably know a thing or two about counting pennies.|| currently in circulation, for a total weight of over 300,000 tons.

The formula for the height of a projectile is:\n\n\\( \\frac{\\text{speed}^2}{2\\times\\text{gravity}} \\)\n\n... which tells us that a champion swimmer moving at 2 meters per second (4.5 mph) would only have enough kinetic energy to lift their body [about 20 centimeters](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%282+m%2Fs%29%5E2+%2F+%282+*+earth+gravity%29) against gravity. \n\nThat's not totally accurate, although it's enough to tell us that dolphin jumps on Earth probably aren't in the cards for us. But to get a more accurate answer (and an equation we can apply to the Moon), we need to account for a few other things.\n\nWhen a swimmer first breaks the surface, they don't have to lift their full weight; they're partially supported by buoyancy. As more of their body leaves the water, the force of buoyancy decreases, since their body is displacing less water. Since the force of gravity isn't changing, their net weight increases. \n\nYou can calculate how much potential energy is required to lift a body vertically through the surface to a certain height, but it's a complicated integral (you integrate the displacement of the submerged portion of their body over the vertical distance they travel) and depends on their body shape. For a human body moving fast enough to jump most of the way out of the water, this effect probably adds about half a torso-length to their final height—and less if they're not able to make it all the way out.\n\nThe other effect we have to account for is the fact that a swimmer can continue kicking as they start to leave the water. When a swimmer is submerged and moving at top speed, the drag from the water is equal to the thrust they generate by kicking and ... whatever the gerund form of the verb is for the things your arms do while swimming. My first thought was \"stroking,\" but it's definitely not that.\n\nAnyway, once the jumping swimmer breaks the surface, the drag almost vanishes, but they can keep kicking for a few moments. To figure out how much energy this adds, you can multiply the thrust from kicking by the distance over which they're kicking after breaking the surface, since energy equals force times distance. The distance is most of a body length, or 1 to 1.5 meters. As for the force from kicking, random Google results for a search for lifeguard qualifications suggest that good swimmers might be able to carry 10 lbs over their heads for a short distance, which means they're generating a little more than 10 pounds-force (50+ N) of kicking thrust.\n\nWe can combine all these together into a big ol' equation:\n\n\\[ \\text{Jump height}=\\left(\\frac{\\tfrac{1}{2}\\times\\text{body mass}\\times\\left(\\text{top speed}\\right)^2+\\text{kick force}\\times\\text{torso length}}{\\text{Earth gravity}\\times\\text{body mass}}\\right)+\\left(\\text{buoyancy correction} \\right) \\]|| footnote contains some detail on the math behind a dolphin jump. Calculating the height a swimmer can jump out of the water requires taking several different things into account, but the bottom line is that a normal swimmer on the Moon could probably launch themselves a full meter out of the water, and Michael Phelps may well be able to manage 2 or 3.",

Instead, you can just plug this equation into Wolfram|Alpha: [(5 billion years / (4 hours/day * 3 months)) / (1% * (speed of light)^2 / (3200 calories/pound))](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%285+billion+years+%2F+%284+hours%2Fday+*+3+months%29%29+%2F+%281%25+*+%28speed+of+light%29%5E2+%2F+%283200+calories%2Fpound%29%29).\n\nLet's walk through it: The first half—the numerator—is a guess for the ratio between how long the Sun has to keep glowing compared to how long a firefly does. I took a wild guess that fireflies have to light up for a few hours each night for one summer, while the Sun has to last another five billion years. The second half—the denominator—is a guess as to the ratio between the stored energy in a pound of firefly vs a pound of star. Nuclear fusion converts about 1% of the input matter to energy, so from E=mc², the stored energy is c² kg/kg, whereas animal matter (say, butter) is about 3,200 food calories per pound. The result should tell us the ratio between a firefly's brightness per pound and the Sun's. And the answer we get says that the fireflies are a few thousand times brighter—which is roughly what we got from working through it the other way!\n\nIt's true that we got lucky with some of our guesses, but since we made errors in both directions, they tended to cancel out.
